You’ve built a great foundation for a dynamic crop detail page—filters, sorting, pagination—it’s got the essentials. To take it up a notch and make it truly delightful and functional, here are some additions you might consider:

---

### 🧾 **New Feature Ideas**
1. **Search Within Listings**  
   Let users keyword search within the listings (e.g., by seller name, region, notes).

2. **Price Range Slider**  
   Add a UI range input to filter listings by a custom min/max price.

3. **Listing Badges or Tags**  
   Use visual markers like “Organic,” “Locally Sourced,” or “Low Stock” for quick scanning.

4. **Interactive Map Preview**  
   Show listing locations on a small map (static or using a map API like Leaflet or Mapbox).

5. **Favorites or Watchlist**  
   Let logged-in users “save” listings for later viewing.

6. **Inline Contact or Inquiry Button**  
   Add a “Message Seller” or “Request Quote” button per listing for quicker user interaction.

7. **Crop Images Carousel or Gallery**  
   Enhance listing cards with a small image gallery for better visual context.

8. **Real-Time Availability Tag**  
   Display labels like “Just added” or “Selling Fast” based on listing age or view count.

9. **Review & Ratings Section**  
   Display seller or listing feedback, and allow logged-in users to leave reviews.

10. **Skeleton Loaders or Loading States**  
   To improve perceived performance, show placeholder content while data is fetched.
